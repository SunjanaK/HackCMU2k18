# HackCMU2k18

This program improves special-needs users’ reading skills by giving feedback in real time as they read a sentence. It accomplishes this through the ListPrinter.py file. 
To run the ListPrinter.py file, you will need to authenticate the Google Cloud APIS.
Do this by typing:

export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="[pathtoHACKCMU.json]" in the terminal.

For example, from SunjanaK's computer, this looks like:

export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/Users/sunjana/Desktop/HackCMU2k18/HACKCMU.json"

Afterwards, you can run the ListPrinter.py file.
